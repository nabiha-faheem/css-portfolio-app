I began my coding journey in September 2023, starting with HTML and CSS, and quickly moved on to learning TypeScript during the first quarter of my studies at GIAIC. Currently, I am diving into Next.js and Tailwind CSS in Quarter 2, where I’m honing my skills to build modern, responsive web applications.

// I’m driven by curiosity and the thrill of problem-solving, and I constantly challenge myself to expand my technical knowledge. As I continue my learning journey, I look forward to creating innovative projects and contributing to the dynamic world of web development.
